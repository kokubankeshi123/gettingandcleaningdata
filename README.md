The repository is created for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera. The purpose of the project is to produce a clean data set from data obtained from an experiment on wearable computing. The full description of the experiment is available at the site where the data were retrieved.

This repository contains the following files.

- README.md
- CodeBook.md: Description of the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the original data in UCI HAR Dataset
- run_analysis.R : R script of the analysis

Working directory has to be set at the file "UCI HAR Dataset" in the original data in order to run the R script.
